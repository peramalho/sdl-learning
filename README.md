# SDL Learning

This project is dedicated to exploring the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, a powerful tool for developing cross-platform multimedia applications such as games, audio software, and simulators.

## Overview

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a low-level hardware abstraction library that provides access to graphics, audio, input devices, and more. This repository contains a collection of tutorials, examples, and experiments aimed at helping developers learn and master SDL.
